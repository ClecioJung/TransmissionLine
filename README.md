# TransmissionLine

## Overview

**TransmissionLine** is a simulation of a [Transmission Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_line). It posseses the following characteristics:

- Developed with MATLAB R2019b;
- Simulated using the [Telegrapher's equations with losses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegrapher%27s_equations);
- The partial differential equation is resolved numerically using [Finite difference methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method);

## Usage

Download this project and run the `TransmissionLine.m` script using your MATLAB. It should produce some graphs and this animation:
